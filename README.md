Created a UFC career mode in Java, allowing users to select their fighting style, enhance their skills through training, and pursue the ultimate goal of securing a UFC contract to become either a champion or a journeyman in the UFC.

Further steps to improve:
1)Future Steps: Develop an updated version incorporating a user interface (UI) and animations.
2)Enhance realism within the simulations and game mechanics. For instance, include weigh-ins and press conferences where players can make dialogue choices.
